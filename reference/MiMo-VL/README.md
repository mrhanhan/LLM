#### Model Recommendation

Both versions of the MiMo-VL-7B-2508 model are now open-sourced on Hugging Face:  
- [🤗 **MiMo-VL-7B-RL-2508**](https://huggingface.co/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL-7B-RL-2508 )
  - Recommended for most users to experience and utilize.  
- [🤗 **MiMo-VL-7B-SFT-2508**](https://huggingface.co/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL-7B-SFT-2508  )
  - Users may perform SFT and RL based on this model. Compared to the previous SFT version, this model demonstrates higher RL stability.  

#### Deployment Parameters
- temperature=0.3, topp=0.95  
- The system prompt is already set in `chat_template.json` and does not require additional configuration.
  


#### Thinking Control

Users can control the thinking mode by appending `/no_think` to queries:  
- **Thinking mode query** (default):  
  *"What is the answer to the question in the image?"*  
- **Non-thinking mode query**:  
  *"Identify the text in the image. /no_think"*. 

❗️Important: The `/no_think` command must be the very last part of user message, which means after `/no_think`, there shouldn't be any user content like image or video.
  
#### Placing Visual Input
For prompts with a single image or video, always place the visual media before the text. For example:

✅ Good:
```
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": image_path},
            {"type": "text",  "text": "Describe the image. /no_think"},
        ],
    }
]
```

❌ Bad:
```
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text",  "text": "Describe the image. /no_think"},
            {"type": "image", "image": image_path},
        ],
    }
]
```

## I. Introduction

In this report, we share our efforts to build a compact yet powerful VLM, MiMo-VL-7B. MiMo-VL-7B comprises (1) a native resolution ViT encoder that preserves fine-grained visual details, (2) an MLP projector for efficient cross-modal alignment, and (3) our [MiMo-7B language model](https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo), specifically optimized for complex reasoning tasks. 

The development of MiMo-VL-7B involves two sequential training processes: (1) A four-stage pre-training phase, which includes projector warmup, vision-language alignment, general multi-modal pre-training, and long-context Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This phase yields the MiMo-VL-7B-SFT model. (2) A subsequent post-training phase, where we introduce Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning (MORL), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates diverse reward signals spanning perception accuracy, visual grounding precision, logical reasoning capabilities, and human/AI preferences. This phase yields the MiMo-VL-7B-RL model.

<p align="center">
  <img width="95%" src="https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL/raw/main/figures/benchmarks.png?raw=true">
</p>

We open-source MiMo-VL-7B series, including checkpoints of the SFT and RL model.
We believe this report along with the models will provide valuable insights to develop powerful reasoning VLMs that benefit the larger community.

### 🛤️ During this journey, we find

- **Incorporating high-quality, broad-coverage reasoning data from the pre-training stage is crucial for enhancing model performance**
  - We curate high-quality reasoning data by identifying diverse queries, employing large reasoning models to regenerate responses with long CoT, and applying rejection sampling to ensure quality.
  - Rather than treating this as supplementary fine-tuning data, we incorporate substantial volumes of this synthetic reasoning data directly into the later pre-training stages, where extended training yields continued performance improvements without saturation.
- **Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning further enhances model performance, while achieving stable simultaneous improvements remains challenging**
  - We apply RL across diverse capabilities, including reasoning, perception, grounding, and human preference alignment, spanning modalities including text, images, and videos. While this hybrid training approach further unlock model’s potential, interference across data domains remains a challenge.
